# BananaBrowser
## BananaBrowser is a modern proxy-based browser mostly used for school reasons. - It uses UltraViolet as it's backend.
# Why use BananaBrowser?
## BananaBrowser is usefull in ways that other proxies aren't. For example, BananaBrowser can detect if one UltraViolet server is down and uses another one. It can also use other backends such as Rammerhead or Abyss Web Services.
